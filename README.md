## About Tickety
Tickety is made to help you give your users support. It enables you to streamline your support process to reduce the stress on your support team. Support via discord is usually experienced as really pleasant by the endusers due to the fact it feels personal, Tickety will increase this feeling even further. It's ease of use will make your staff get used to it quickly. Tickety's core features will always stay free to help you help!

## Premium
Tickety is free to use for everyone, however we offer a premium version of Tickety that has just some more features.
We ask a small price for Tickety premium so that we are able to keep hosting and updating the bot.
