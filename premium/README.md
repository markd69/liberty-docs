# Premium
Tickety is free to use for everyone, however we offer a premium version of Tickety that has just some more features.
We ask a small price for Tickety premium so that we are able to keep hosting and updating the bot.

## What does premium offer?
Premium unlocks a couple advanced features that are really helpful for servers that heavily rely on Tickety.

These are the features that premium includes:  
| Feature | Command |
| ------- | ------- |
| :white_check_mark: Custom Ticket Welcome Message | [-setmsg](/commands/#set-message-command) |
| :white_check_mark: Ticket Transcripts in both HTML and TXT format | [-transcript](/commands/#transcript-command) |
