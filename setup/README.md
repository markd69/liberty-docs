# Setup
Setting Tickety up should be an easy process, however it could be a bit confusing. This page should guide you through setting Tickety up.

## Inviting Tickety
Click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=352854019934257156&scope=bot&permissions=8) to invite tickety to your server.

You should then see a popup, telling you to select a server. Select the server you want Tickety to be invited to, and hit 'Authorize'.
You can now close this tab.

::: warning NOTICE
If you don't see the server you want to invite Tickety to, make sure you have the `Administrator` permission on that server.

## Creating the Support Team Role
Tickety needs a role called exactly `Support Team` to function. This will default as the admin role for all Tickety commands.
This role will also be added to all tickets, so everyone that should be able to read **all** tickets should have this role.

To create a role, first select your desired server from the sidebar on the left in the discord app.
Then in the upper left corner click the name of your discord server, then in the dropdown menu select `Server Settings`.
Press `Roles` in the left sidebar, then press the `+` above where all the roles are listed.
Now name the role exactly (case sensitive) `Support Team`. And press the green `Save Changes` button at the bottom.

Now assign the role to yourself and type `-help` in any channel to see if Tickety is configured correctly. 
If it returns a list of all commands you're good to go.

::: tip
This huge list of commands can seem overwhelming, take a look at our [Commands Guide](/commands/) to see what they do.
